#Overview

This is the code I developed to play the snake game. I used the PyGame library for the GUI.

I added couple simple features: each food block is a unique colour (in that game), and when eaten, the tail piece appended to the snake is that same colour. It makes for some pretty cool designs!

Another feature I added was the ability to restart the game from the same window once the player dies. This makes it easier to keep playing instead of having to run the code again a separate time.

Try downloading the code and playing yourself. Let me know what you think, or if you have any tips. I'd love to hear them. Enjoy!
